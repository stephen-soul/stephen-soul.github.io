		<p class="w3-center"><em>I&#39;m A Software Developer</em></p>

		<p>
			My name is Stephen Fetinko and I&#39;m a software developer graduate of NSCC with a diploma in Programming. 
			Programming for me has always been a passion of mine. It started from playing around with HTML to edit home pages, 
			and eventually it led me to learning more about the games I loved and how they were made. My passion had fuel added 
			to the fire at the end of high school when I took a class that delved into Java and from there, I pursued learning 
			everything possible about making anything from desktop/mobile development to game development.

			<p id="firstParagraph">Finding out how the world ticks is something that has always interested me and figuring out complicated puzzles is always an enjoyable experience. There&#39;s not a whole lot more that can be said about me. I code a lot, I build computers and I drink a bunch of coffee. But I&#39;m a hard worker who never leaves a task undone, and I make sure that when I&#39;m on a team I do everything possible to make everybody&#39;s job easier. I love learning new things and if I find a website that&#39;s done a certain way or an application that&#39;s done a unique way then I go out of my way to ensure I figure out how it works so I can learn more and constantly improve. As an example, this site was built off of a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp">W3.CSS Template</a> with a <a href="https://bootswatch.com/">bootswatch</a> theme that I worked to customize and make my own.</p>
			&nbsp;

			<p>My programming career has been and will be a journey. I&#39;ve learned an incredible amount from my teachers and my peers and I look forward to learning more and more about how the world works. At the end of the day, I&#39;m a software developer, and it&#39;s a pleasure to meet you.</p>

				<p class="w3-center">Code provided on request</p>

				<h3>Summary of the project?</h3>

				<p>A maze made in Javascript. Starts with an intro screen that asks for a name and a submit button. The name gets stored in session and as long as it&#39;s not empty or 2 or less characters, you will be taken to the actual game page.</p>

				<h3>What&#39;s the goal?</h3>

				<p>Once playing, you&#39;ll be at the screen pictured above. You then have the option to move with the arrow keys, WASD or on screen buttons. The idea is that you are a monkey and you are tasked with finding the banana.</p>

				<h3>What&#39;s the challenge?</h3>

				<p>The goal is to get to the end of the maze. The challenge is that the maze is randomly generated every time, and it&#39;s not always super easy. The randomness of the maze was generated from a tutorial but everything else was coded to make a game out of this.</p>

				<h3>What challenges have I faced making this/What are my takeaways from this?</h3>

				<p>Coming from Java and C++ before dipping into Javascript, I had a few issues getting the hang of how Javascript was written. Aside from the language barrier, my only coding issues were with the form on submit. The other issue I found was cookies caching and changes not applying. The form submit was an issue because I was validating through Javascript and the issue was fixed by instead of the button doing the submitting, I had my actual form have an on submit. After those minor issues and the languages differences I ended up finding my own way to code the game portion and everything came after that. This helped me learn a little more about javascript and because it was game focused, it made the process a lot more fun and a lot easier for me.</p>

			<div id="cppMazeSolverDocumentation">
				<p class="w3-center">Code provided on request</p>

				<h3>Summary of the project?</h3>

				<p>A maze solver made in C++. The program takes in a maze through a text file, dumps it into a dynamic array, and then solves it using stacks. The dynamic array (not a vector) is done a little wacky, but it works. The idea originally was to make an array of strings. My implementation ended up using an array of strings without implementing strings. The result, because strings in C++ are an array of chars, was an array of chars of chars. It wasn&#39;t the goal but it fit the style and it solved it.</p>

				<h3>What&#39;s the goal?</h3>

				<p>Specifically, select a maze made in a text file from the debug folder through an on screen console based menu. Then the program will then store each step done in a stack and make the needed moves. When it makes progress, leave an X, when it goes back, remove the X.</p>

				<h3>What challenges have I faced making this/What are my takeaways from this?</h3>

				<p>The only challenge I found I ended up putting on myself. I didn&#39;t intend to make the array of chars of chars and doing so certainly provided interesting challenges. Most notable was the maze only solving so much before I ended up with a segfault error. But that was a mix of how I made the array and how I handled the win condition. After checking for a win before anything else, everything worked just fine. This was my first real look into using stacks, specifically, and because this was done at the same time as the javascript maze, I was just happy to be done with mazes. But it helped me learn a little more about C++ and although I did some things a little weirder than I should have, it has helped me manage C++ a lot more than I could beforehand.</p>

				<p class="w3-center">Code provided on request</p>

				<h3>Summary of the project?</h3>

				<p>An Android application meant to allow the user to store videos from YouTube locally on their smart device, and store the saved links in a sqlite database.</p>

				<h3>What&#39;s the goal?</h3>

				<p>The goal was to make an application that could utilize the YouTube api to store videos locally. The way this application works is by letting the user enter a name of a video, add a url, a rating and a description. The way the video works is by having the user go to the mobile YouTube app, find a video, and specifically go to share and then copy the url. That reason you copy that specific url is because of the way the app splits the string. From there, it can get the embedded YouTube video to load the video and have all the functionality of YouTube, all while your links are stored in a sqlite database that you can add or delete from at any time.</p>

				<h3>What challenges have I faced making this/What are my takeaways from this?</h3>

				<p>This project was a real interesting journey. At this point of time I had only ever made smaller apps, specifically for Magic The Gathering to track your life, and played around with changing colours. This app had the new challenge of figuring out how sqlite worked in Android and how to use the YouTube api. Sqlite wasn&#39;t a challenge, but getting string values into the database did provide some complications just because it was my first time using databases in Android. The YouTube api was another issue. I needed to read a ton of documentation and even then it just didn&#39;t want to work. Eventually I found the specific way it wanted the string and the api key and from there, everything fell in place. I managed to learn a lot more about Android because of this project and as soon as it was done it opened up a lot more application ideas that I&#39;m able to make, specifically utilizing sqlite databases.</p>

			<img alt="Space invaders style Windows Forms game" id="winformGame" src="img/bullethell.png" />
			<div id="winformGameDocumentation">
				<p class="w3-center">Code provided on request</p>

				<h3>Summary of the project?</h3>

				<p>A bullet hell style game made in Windows Forms with GDI+. One life, bunch of bullets, survive all the waves of enemies.</p>

				<h3>What&#39;s the goal?</h3>

				<p>The goal of the game is to survive 3 waves of enemies and then a boss wave. You only have the one life, and enemies take a bunch of shots to kill.</p>

				<h3>What&#39;s the challenge?</h3>

				<p>The goal is to kill all the enemies. The challenge is that each wave gets faster each time, and each wave has a hive mind. They all shoot at the same time, and because you only have one life, things will get more intense than previously thought. You will die very quick if you&#39;re not paying attention. Each death will restart the game.</p>

				<h3>What challenges have I faced making this/What are my takeaways from this?</h3>

				<p>This kind of thing is my passion. Making games has always been my favourite thing. This was my first take on taking on the Windows Forms, and making a game out of it was a lot of fun, but it wasn&#39;t without its challenges. The issues that are noteworthy were waves that would vanish all at once, enemies that would die all at once, and key presses causing some unneeded issues. When it came to the waves vanishing it was just down to how I was handling waves, and tracking each wave individually fixed that. The issue with bullets was because bullets were done in a hash set, and because the damage was based on the amount of bullets in the hash set. I managed a quick and dirty solution to change the health of the enemies and limiting the bullets to get my initial idea. When it came to the key press issues, it was due to a key down event. The way that my movement worked was on a separate timer. The way my shooting worked was not the same as the movement, which I had set up to make movement smoother. The issue with the way shooting worked was that it would only shoot fast if I wasn&#39;t moving, and then it would spam shots, and then stop if I was moving. I changed the shooting to shoot on key up which limited the speed of shots and made everything work as intended. This project proved a lot more fun than I had originally thought and it helped bring out my game design brain.</p>

			<img alt="Pacman made in Unity" id="unityMan" src="img/pacboard.PNG" />
			<div id="unityManDocumentation">
				<p class="w3-center">Code on GitHub is in progress</p>

				<h3>Summary of the project?</h3>

				<p>Pacman made in Unity, that I&#39;ve dubbed Unityman, made through a tutorial with my own touches added on at the end (tutorial I based this off of was located <a href="https://noobtuts.com/unity/2d-pacman-game">here</a>.)</p>

				<h3>What&#39;s the goal?</h3>

				<p>The goal is to remake one of the most iconic games, Pacman, and add my own touches to make it look a little more my own.</p>

				<h3>What&#39;s the challenge?</h3>

				<p>It&#39;s Pacman, which can be a challenge all on its own for some. But it&#39;s also made with a little easier AI that is also faster than need be. The AI&#39;s patterns are also harder to memorize and they can catch you off guard.</p>

				<h3>What challenges have I faced making this/What are my takeaways from this?</h3>

				<p>Following along with the tutorial walked me through my first delve into Unity as a game engine. As an engine, it&#39;s a lot of fun and easy enough to work with. But also as an engine, there were a few things I did through the tutorial that took a long time. Taking a look at the map, I ended up having to add the colliders all manually. Colliders in Unity are just something that tells the program where collisions can be found. They define the shape, or at least a rough approximation, and are invisible to the player while playing. They are essential for telling where the map is and where each wall is. Setting up all 51 manually caused some issues, specifically with movement.</p>

				<p>The colliders need to be roughly even numbers and not decimals that extend in length. So having one be 1.25 is far better than having one that&#39;s 1.2548545 because that was how my original setup was. And every play test had me randomly sticking to the wall as it was velcro, and in one instance, had me sucked into the wall like the corner was a black hole. Another challenge faced could be the pacdots. Each individual pacdot. You don&#39;t need to count as I had to manually add all 328 duplicating the last, editing the size to make it next to the last, and slowly make my way through the maze. But it was a lot of fun as much as it was a challenge. Speaking of pacdots, I did run into an issue where every pacdot would randomly disappear for seemingly no reason, but that boiled down to me grouping every pacdot under the first instead of the board during a cleanup. But past that, no other issues really came to be.</p>

				<p>After the tutorial concluded I was left with Pacman, 51 colliders, 328 pacdots, and one ghost. But it did provide a basis for me to add a scoreboard and a game over/win. From there I looked into the documents for Unity and the Unity forms to figure out how to add the score, how to pause a game for when the user wins or loses, and how to restart upon win or loss. At the end, I had a lot of fun with the project and it taught me a lot about Unity as an engine and really solidified making games as my end goal.</p>

				<h3>What is it?</h3>
				<p>A game I'm currently working on using the Godot game engine. I've always loved writing stories and ever since I was a kid I've always wanted to make a game. So here I am - using the Godot game engine to make a passion project thats a cumulation of the things I love. The end goal, for now, is to create something that is a melting pot of games of my youth; a JRPG inspired game mixed with action elements for the combat, with some western influences mixed in. Using the Godot game engine has really allowed me to hammer out my ideas in an efficient way, all whilst allowing me the creative power to make whatever I want. I look forward to sharing more when possible.</p>

				<h3>What is it?</h3>
				<p>My first time playing around with QTC++. There's a few small little quirks that I hope to get back and fix, but for the time being it stands as my first real attempt at using something sort of new, straight out of college, creating an app from scratch. And this was the result; a cross platform C++ task app. It's extremely simple, but I was proud with the outcome.</p>
